# Hello and welcome to my little blog.


As the first post, I'd like to just do a quick introduction to what this is. 
This is a personal blog and maintained by a random guy on the internet ðŸ˜‰. I post things that I like / find intriguing / interesting / just anything I want, it's mine afterall ðŸ˜›

A little backstory, I've been thinking on having a blog of my own for quite some time now and it finally happened! Honestly, it's been delayed for quite some time now mainly because I'm just lazy and definitely taking my sweet-sweet time considering between writing vanilla HTML/CSS or using a static site generator. And as you might've notice I decided to use a static site generator. 

For closing this welcoming post, just a quick reminder, as this is just a personal blog, one is advised to not take anything on this blog very seriously and take it as "just a wind coming by". 


That's it bye ðŸ‘‹
