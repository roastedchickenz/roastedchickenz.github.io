Hello!
Today I wanna share my experience and what I think the best topic in philosophy for people who don't want to be very serious into philosophy, yet, want to try and taste to what philosophy is. 

```A quick disclaimer before I begin!  
Although I've been delving in philosophy for about 5 years, I just enjoy reading random philosophy article and watch a video essay about philosophy.   
I don't study philosophy very thoroughly nor academically so you probably shouldn't take this writing (and 95% of the internet in general) very seriously. 
Let's start shall we?
```

Philosophy literally translates to "love of wisdom", although I don't think people are using the word Philosophy to express "love of wisdom", in a broad sense, learning philosophy means somebody want to seek for the "deeper truths" (whatever that may means to you). 

To get to the "deeper truths" however, usually, one has to be honest with themselves and question everything they know about a particular subject until they realize, we're living in a world full of assumptions.  
Often, when we question all of these assumptions, we reached an uncomfortable level of realization or questioning. I think this is one of the main reason why (at least people around me) many people think philosophy is bad.  
Now, assumptions is **NOT** a bad thing, in fact, to lay 
out an argument about something, one **have to** assume some things are correct without proof, these are usually called **Axioms**.  
What is bad however, when we assume some things are correct and just accepted it without a single question. 
Let me be clear here, there's nothing wrong with not philosophizing about everything in the world, no one can do that!, we human just not meant to process all the things in the world. Just pick a few topic that you like and you're good to go!


Enough boring formal introduction. I have 2 main things to say in this blog; stoicism and optimistic nihilism. 

## Stoicism
This is a quite popular topic because of it's kinda unique way for approaching life problem. Basically, stoicism really comes down to 1 question: 
Is this thing (could be your problem, your thoughts, whatever) under my control? If it's under my control, I should react calmly and logically. If not, accept it and move on. 

The stoic thinks that there're a lot of things in the world that are out of our control. The **ONLY** thing that we can control is how we react to the stuff that we can't control.  

For example, you can't control time and aging. So what are you gonna do about it? Well, the stoic just accept that aging and death is inevitable. This doesn't mean that the stoic blindly accept it and do nothing about it.  
Again, the only thing we can control is our own reaction. So, what would the stoic do? They probably think ahead to the future and foresee, what could they do now to increase their wellbeing when they age. It may includes saving money, be a good person in general, etc. 

Another probably more applicable example would be: let's say that you're a world class athlete competing. To succeed in the competition, you train as hard as you can, you listen to what your trainer has to say, you eat well, etc.  
But you should know, you could not control what will the referee do. The referee might be having a bad day or a bad meal and judge you wrongly and unjustly.  
Many of us would be tempted to get angry and get revenge to the referee, but the stoic thinks different. The stoic would just accept that we can't control the referee's emotion. We can however tell the referee calmly as to why we think they are wrong.  
Stoicism does not teach to turn a blind eye to unjustment. In fact one of the earliest stoic, Lucius Seneca fight against, at the time, slavery and calls out their inhumane treatment.  

The Stoics also believed that compared to other creatures, we human beings are not the strongest, nor the fastest. Instead, the unique human capacity is the ability to reason. Thus according to stoic, for human, reasoning is the best way to thrive, flourish, and live a good life.  

You may have heard that CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) used in modern psychology derived from stoicism in that we're recognizing harmful thought pattern and try to choose logic instead of irrational thinking.  
If that doesn't convince you to learn more about stoicism, I don't know what will.  
Some old ancient greek dude somehow discovered the base of therapy used by modern psychology.  

## Optimistic nihilism

You might have heard about nihilism before. The belief that we doesn't matter and no matter what we do it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. You fail your exam? Cool, the sun still shines brightly. You get to Harvard? Amazing, earth's gravity still at 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. We're just a puny little human on the universe afterall. We haven't even traveled our solar system yet.  

This thought might be depressing to a lot of people and it's not a surprise when I put it that way. But it doesn't have to be depressing. Introducing Optimistic Nihilism... 

The main difference between nihilism and optimistic nihilism is that whilst nihilism busy getting depressed at how life doesn't have a meaning and living is meaningless, optimistic nihilism saw an opportunity that live doesn't matter, so no matter what you do, do it because you wanted to and do the things that makes you happy.

Optimistic nihilism sees that life doesn't have a meaning, therefore, you should create your own meaning and purpose. It doesn't have to be a grandiosey big boy meaning of life. It can be as simple as just being a good person. 

You want to be a professional chef? Great, go ahead and learn to cook. You want to write a dumb blog preaching philosophy even though you know close to none about it? That's good too I guess?    
The point being **No one cares what you do so just do whatever makes you happy** 

## Final note
Although this blog is written in such a way that may look like the answer of everything in life, I got bad news for you, knowing and understanding these thing won't solve your problem nor make you the richest person in the world.  
What this writing will tell you however, to do whatever you want in life, when you do, you will certainly face problems in life, at that time, face your problem logically and rationally.  
This writing won't cure your depression either, what this writing will tell you however, you cannot choose if you want to be depressed or not, but you can choose how you want to mitigate it.  

That's it from me, Thank you for reading till the end üòâÔ∏è.
